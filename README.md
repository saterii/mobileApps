# Course feedback

### How you feel the content of the course (overall)?  
I think the course contained a lot of valuable information about mobile app development and works as a great starting point for anyone who wants to learn as much as possible to the technologies related to it. It introduced me to a variety of different technologies and frameworks that i can choose from if i am ever to create a more complex mobile app.
### How you feel the course web site and materials in Labranet GitLab?  
The website for the course is really clear and easy to navigate, and contains all of the necessary information and material well in one place.
### Is the material suitable for a contact/virtual study? If not, what should be improved?  
The material in my opinion is suitable for both contact and virtual studying, as there are a lot of videos, text, code snippets and full applications within it.
### How about workload (low, ok, too much)?  
I think the workload is what is to be expected from a 5ect course.
### How about evaluation (exercises and research assignment)?  
The evaluation is good, because it encourages the students to create a end project and learn more by doing so if they want to achieve the grade of 5.
### Give a rating number from 1-5 (5 == excellent) to this course at overall  
5
### Self evaluation
I ran out of steam mid-course, and completed most of the tasks in a short period of time because of that. I feel like I learned what the course was meant to teach, but due to a lack of energy to create an end project I didn't achieve my initial goal of grade 5. :(  

    
Overall, I found this course to be really fun and it made the contents of it seem really interesting, and the teacher was always willing and happy to answer any question and help with any problem (no matter how stupid :D), so big thanks to you!
